# bshell-utils

As in Bash Shell Utils.

This repository contains libraries I do during several years, mainly for [Gen√®se project](https://github.com/blankoworld/genese/).

# Usage

You can use them as submodules, for example in your project:

```bash
git submodule add https://gilab.com/blankoworld/bshell-utils lib/utils
```

Then import some of them in your Bash shell scripts, in example for `common.bash` library:

```bash
source ./lib/utils/common.bash
```
